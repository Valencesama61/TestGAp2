# TrellTech

Minimal React Native (Expo) app that demonstrates integration with the Trello REST API.

Features included (minimal, demo-style):

- CRUD Workspaces (Trello organizations)
- CRUD Boards
- CRUD Lists
- CRUD Cards
- Assign members to cards

Architecture follows the layout under `src/` with a small API layer, services, hooks, stores and simple screens.

### Requirements
- Node.js, npm
- Expo CLI
- Trello API key & token (see documentation)

### Setup

1. Install dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

2. Configure Trello credentials

Add your Trello API key and token to `.env` 

```text
EXPO_PUBLIC_TRELLO_API_BASE_URL = "https://api.trello.com/1"
EXPO_PUBLIC_TRELLO_API_KEY="your_key_here"
EXPO_PUBLIC_TOKEN="your_token_here"
```

3. Run the app

```sh
npx expo start
   # or 
npm start
```

### Project structure

See the `src/` folder — key modules:

- `src/api/trello` — axios client, endpoints and interceptors
- `src/features/*` — features: workspaces, boards, lists, cards, profile. Each contains components, hooks, screens and services
- `src/store` — zustand stores
- `src/navigation` — simple navigator
- `src/shared/hooks/useAPIHEALTH.js` — API health check

### :Testing

Unit tests are configured with Jest. Example tests mock the axios client.

```sh
npm test
```

Notes & conventions
- The app uses query parameters `key` and `token` on every Trello request (Trello API requirement)
- Services are thin wrappers that return Trello responses directly for clarity
- Stores are kept simple with loading/error states and common operations

Next steps (not implemented here):
- Add more complete UI (drag and drop Kanban)
- Add member management UI and selection when assigning members to cards
- Add optimistic updates and better error handling UX

3. Create or manage your tasks and assign members directly through the app.
4. Use the **Logout** button to disconnect your Trello account when you're done.
